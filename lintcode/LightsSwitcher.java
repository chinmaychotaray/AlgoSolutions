/*
There is a room with n lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on
the wall. After performing exactly m unknown operations towards buttons, you
need to return how many different kinds of status of the n lights could be.

Suppose n lights are labeled as number [1, 2, 3 ..., n], function of these 4
buttons are given below:

You can flip all the lights.
You can flip lights with even numbers.
You can flip lights with odd numbers.
You can flip lights with (3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...

Example
Given n = 1, m = 1.
return 2 // Status can be: [on], [off]

Given n = 2, m = 1.
return 3 // Status can be: [on, off], [off, on], [off, off]
 */
public class LightsSwitcher {

    /*
     * @param : number of lights
     * @param : number of operations
     * @return: the number of status
     */
    public int flipLights(int n, int m) {
        // write your code here
    }

}
